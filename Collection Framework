Ans 1) 
The Collection framework in Java provides a set of classes and interfaces to store and manipulate groups of objects. It is part of the java.util package and includes:
Interfaces like List, Set, Queue, Deque, and Map.

Ans 2)
ArrayList uses a dynamic array; it is faster for random access but slower for insertion and deletion in the middle.
LinkedList uses a doubly linked list; it is slower for random access but faster for insertion and deletion.

Ans 3)
Iterator allows only forward traversal and works for all collections.
ListIterator allows both forward and backward traversal but works only for lists.

Ans 4)
Iterator supports element removal and is modern, used in newer collections.
Enumeration does not support element removal and is used in legacy collections

Ans 5)
List allows duplicates and maintains the order of elements.
Set does not allow duplicates and does not guarantee order.

Ans 6)
HashSet is faster and does not maintain order.
TreeSet is slower but keeps elements in sorted order.

AN s7)
Array is fixed in size and can store primitives.
ArrayList is resizable and stores only objects.
