Ans 1)
Binding of data and corresponding method into a single unit is called Encapsulation.
If any Java class follows data hiding and abstraction then such class is reffred as encapsulated class.
Eg: Data hiding+data Abstraction
Ans 2)
Feature of encapsulation aRE:
  I)DATA Hiding
  ii)Access Control
  iii)Modularity
  iv)Flexibility
  v)Validation

Ans 3)
Features of encapsulation are :
  i) Getters: It is used to get the value from the instance variable of the class
  ii) setters: It is used to set the value to the instance variable of the class.

Ans 4)
This keyword in Java refers to the current object, which means the instance of the class being referenced. 
It serves several important purposes in object-oriented programming, particularly in Java.

Ans 5)
Advantages:
To the outside world the data should not be exposed directly
Our internal data should not go to the outside world directly that is outside people should not access our internal data
BY using private modifiers we can implement data hiding.

Ans 6)
In Java, encapsulation is achieved by hiding an object's internal state and providing access to it via getter and setter methods. 
This helps in protecting the objectâ€™s data from unauthorized access and modification. Encapsulation is implemented using the following steps:

Declare the class fields (variables) as private: This ensures that they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
Provide public getter and setter methods: These methods allow controlled access to the private fields. 
The getter method is used to retrieve the value of the field, and the setter method is used to modify the value of the field.
